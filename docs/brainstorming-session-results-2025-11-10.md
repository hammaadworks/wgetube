### Technique: Five Whys

**The Core Problem:** How can we empower productive personal growth during disconnected moments?

*   **1. Why build a downloader?**
    *   To let people reliably download videos.
*   **2. Why is that important?**
    *   To bypass platform restrictions and watch content locally, anytime.
*   **3. Why is local access important?**
    *   To not feel disconnected and to feel productive when offline.
    *   To save internet bandwidth by not re-streaming.
    *   To have an ad-free, uninterrupted viewing experience.
*   **4. Why is that feeling important?**
    *   To use time productively and indulge in studies (like Quran Hifz).
*   **5. Why is that important?**
    *   To make the most of one's time for personal and professional growth, especially during commutes in places with poor internet.

**Core Insight:** The fundamental need is to **empower productive personal growth during disconnected moments.**
